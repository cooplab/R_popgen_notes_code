```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(prompt=FALSE, comment="", fig.width=6, fig.height=6)
```

First, we need to install R, RStudio, and a few R packages. Follow these steps:

1. **Download R and Install R**. R is available from the "Comprehensive R
Archive Network" (CRAN): https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/. Download the version
for your operating system using this link. Install R by double clicking the
installer you've downloaded in the previous step and follow the instructions.
CRAN is also how you install packages that extend R's functionality (more on
this later).

2. **Download and install RStudio**. RStudio is a program that makes
interacting with and developing code in R *much* easier. Download RStudio
Desktop from their website:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. Double click the RStudio
installer and follow the installation instructions.

Open RStudio and try entering:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
print("Welcome to EVE102!")
```

in the window labeled "Console". It should look something like this (but your
exact session will be different):

3. Next, we need to install a few R packages from CRAN. R packages are
contributed software that extends the functionality of R. We will first install
`devtools`, as this allows us to install the `eve102` course package from
GitHub (GitHub is a website for sharing code and collaboratively working on
projects). Then, we will load the `devtools` package with the `library()`
function, and then install the `eve102`:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('vsbuffalo/eve102', build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
