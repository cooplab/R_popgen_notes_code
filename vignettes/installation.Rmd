R is a programming language designed for statistical computing. It allows you
to do incredibly powerful data manipulation, fit statistical models, and
visualize data. R has grown incredibly popular in recent years (e.g., see this
[New York Times
articles](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)
on R), and is the foundation of most of modern data science. We'll use R in
this course, and while at times it may be tricky (learning new programming
languages is *always* tricky), it's worth the effort as knowing R is a very
marketable skill. We'll cover the basics here, but other excellent references
are:

 - [R in a Nutshell](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/r/9781449358204) by Joseph Alder. Available online through the UC Davis campus proxy.
 - [The Art of R Programming](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/NSPpart.pdf) by Norman Matloff (UC Davis computer science professor). 
 - [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. This is a great online resource (and now, [published book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20)).

## Installing R and RStudio

First, we need to install R, RStudio, and a few R packages. Follow these steps:

1. **Download R and Install R**. R is available from the "Comprehensive R
Archive Network" (CRAN): https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/. Download the version
for your operating system using this link. Install R by double clicking the
installer you've downloaded in the previous step and follow the instructions.
CRAN is also how you install packages that extend R's functionality (more on
this later).

2. **Download and install RStudio**. RStudio is a program that makes
interacting with and developing code in R *much* easier. Download RStudio
Desktop from their website:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. Double click the RStudio
installer and follow the installation instructions.

Open RStudio and try entering:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
print("Welcome to EVE102!")
```

in the window labeled "Console". It should look something like this (but your
exact session will be different):

3. Next, we need to install a few R packages from CRAN. R packages are
   contributed software that extends the functionality of R. We will first
   install `devtools`, as this allows us to install the `eve102` course package
   from GitHub (GitHub is a website for sharing code and collaboratively
   working on projects). Then, we will load the `devtools` package with the
   `library()` function, and then install the `eve102` package. Note that in general if
   you are prompted to answer any questions during installation, answer the
   affirmative, i.e. 'y' or yes, but see note in 'troubleshooting' section below about not saying yes to installing from 'source'. To install the `eve102` package, run the following (i.e. copy and paste):

```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('cooplab/eve102', build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

4. Finally, test if your eve102 package is working. Run the following (i.e. copy and paste):
```{R, eval=FALSE}
library(eve102) # run this code to load the library/'package'
eve102_status() # should say 'Your eve102 package is the same version as on GitHub'
eve102_data() # should return names of the datasets available to you through the eve102 package
# We will be using these datasets throughout the course & this list will get updated.
```

## Troubleshooting ## 
Having trouble with your installation? Please try the following, and if you still can't get everything installed, ask your TA.

If R asks you whether you would like to install a 'source version' instead of an older 'binary version', say no. This could be phrased something like this:

'There are binary versions available but the source versions
  are later. Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation? y/n:'

You should type 'n' then enter to install the *binary* versions.

If you have used R before on your computer, please check that your R and RStudio versions are the latest available releases. You could have difficulty installing and using the `eve102` package if your R is out-of-date.

You can find out what version of R you are using by typing copying and pasting the following into your console:

version

At time of writing this help file, the current version of R is 3.5.1 'Feather Spray'.

You can find out what version of RStudio you have installed by clicking on *RStudio >> About* in the top menu bar. At the time of writing this help file, the current version of RStudio is 1.1.456.

If your R or RStudio are out-of-date, simply close RStudio, install the latest version using the instructions above, and re-start RStudio. Then follow the instructions to install `devtools` and the `eve102` package.
