R is a programming language designed for statistical computing. It allows you
to do incredibly powerful data manipulation, fit statistical models, and
visualize data. R has grown incredibly popular in recent years (e.g., see this
[New York Times
articles](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/technology/business-computing/07program.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)
on R), and is the foundation of most of modern data science. We'll use R in
this course, and while at times it may be tricky (learning new programming
languages is *always* tricky), it's worth the effort as knowing R is a very
marketable skill. We'll cover the basics here, but other excellent references
are:

 - [R in a Nutshell](http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/book/programming/r/9781449358204) by Joseph Alder. Available online through the UC Davis campus proxy.
 - [The Art of R Programming](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/NSPpart.pdf) by Norman Matloff (UC Davis computer science professor). 
 - [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. This is a great online resource (and now, [published book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1466586966/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=devtools-20)).

## Installing R and RStudio

First, we need to install R, RStudio, and a few R packages. Follow these steps:

1. **Download R and Install R**. R is available from the "Comprehensive R
Archive Network" (CRAN): https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/. Download the version
for your operating system using this link. Install R by double clicking the
installer you've downloaded in the previous step and follow the instructions.
CRAN is also how you install packages that extend R's functionality (more on
this later).

2. **Download and install RStudio**. RStudio is a program that makes
interacting with and developing code in R *much* easier. Download RStudio
Desktop from their website:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/. Double click the RStudio
installer and follow the installation instructions.

Open RStudio and try entering:

```{R, eval=FALSE}
print("Welcome to EVE102!")
```

in the window labeled "Console". It should look something like this (but your
exact session will be different):

3. Next, we need to install a few R packages from CRAN. R packages are
   contributed software that extends the functionality of R. We will first
   install `devtools`, as this allows us to install the `eve102` course package
   from GitHub (GitHub is a website for sharing code and collaboratively
   working on projects). Then, we will load the `devtools` package with the
   `library()` function, and then install the `eve102` package. Note that if
   you are prompted to answer any questions during installation, answer the
   affirmative, i.e. 'y' or yes. Run the following (i.e. copy and paste, then run):

```{R, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('cooplab/eve102', build_vignettes=TRUE)
```

4. Finally, test if your eve102 package is working. Run the following (i.e. copy and paste, then run):
```{R, eval=FALSE}
library(eve102) # run this code to load the library/'package'
eve102_status() # should say 'Your eve102 package is the same version as on GitHub'
eve102_data() # should return names of the datasets available to you through the eve102 package
# We will be using these datasets throughout the course & this list will get updated.
```
